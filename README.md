# Logan LSD Project

A Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) prototype delivering secure, efficient, and liquidity-friendly staking.

## Goals
- Decentralized staking derivatives platform: stake PoS assets and receive derivative tokens.
- Unlock staked liquidity for DeFi (collateral, lending, trading, yield aggregation).
- Improve network security and decentralization via PoS participation.
- Cross-chain staking and interoperability across multi-chain ecosystems.

## Technology Stack
- Blockchain: Ethereum (PoS) initially; design extensible toward Cosmos, Polkadot.
- Smart Contracts: Solidity (Ethereum). Future: Rust/CosmWasm for Cosmos/Polkadot.
- Token Standards: ERC-20 / ERC-4626 for LSD tokens and vault compatibility.
- Cross-chain: IBC/bridges (roadmap) for cross-chain LSD mobility.
- Oracles: Integrate for APR and price feeds.
- Frontend: React (or Vue alternative).
- Backend: Node.js (or Go alternative) for on-chain data sync and staking logic orchestration.

## Core Modules
1) Staking + Derivative Minting
- Users stake PoS assets (e.g., ETH) to receive LSD tokens (e.g., stETH, stATOM-like behavior).

2) LSD Circulation & Use-cases
- Use LSD as collateral in DeFi, lending, trading, and yield aggregation.

3) Rewards & Redemption
- Distribute rewards proportionally; redeem principal by burning LSD tokens.

4) Cross-chain Staking & Interop
- Support multi-chain staking assets; enable cross-chain LSD usage.

5) DAO Governance
- Token-based governance for pool parameters and roadmap; manage strategies and risk.

## Security & Privacy
- Contracts are designed for auditability; follow battle-tested libraries; plan external audits.
- Non-custodial fund flows; avoid single points of failure.
- Multisig and distributed validation where appropriate.
- On-chain transparent accounting and verifiable distributions.

## Roadmap
- Phase 1 (MVP):
  - Ethereum contracts: share-based `StakeManager`, ERC20 `LSDToken` (ERC-4626 alignment in scope).
  - Backend read endpoints (APR preview, deposit/withdraw preview).
  - Frontend dApp (wallet connect, preview flows).
- Phase 2 (Core Expansion):
  - Oracle integration for APR and prices; off-chain indexers.
  - Hardhat/Foundry test coverage expansion; fuzz/property tests.
  - Gas optimizations, events, subgraph integration.
- Phase 3 (Testing & Optimization):
  - Formal verification targets; audit preparation; monitoring and alerts.
  - Cross-chain PoC via bridges/IBC for LSD mobility.
- Phase 4 (Docs & Launch Readiness):
  - Operations runbooks, risk disclosures, governance docs.

## Development
- Contracts: `contracts/` (Hardhat). Tests under `contracts/test`.
- Backend: `backend/` (Express + ethers). Set `RPC_URL`, `STAKE_MANAGER_ADDRESS` and optionally provide ABI via env.
- Frontend: `frontend/` (React + Vite). Wallet connect and preview integration.
